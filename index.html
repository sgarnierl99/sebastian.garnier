      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I studied Economics with a specialization in Finance and also completed a double major in Environmental Studies. 
        Throughout my degree, I worked on projects in corporate finance, stock and company valuations, and financial math. 
        Here, I’ve attached some of those projects as well as others I’ve developed on my own to strengthen my skills with different tools and programs. 
        My academic journey also shaped my strong interest in ESG and sustainable finance, where I see an opportunity to combine my background in economics with my commitment to the environment.

        I began my career as a bank teller at TD while I was still in university, which gave me my first exposure to the financial industry. 
        After graduation, I joined Fisgard Asset Management in 2023, where I obtained my Exempt Market Dealer certification. 
        Today, I work in a hybrid role as both an Investment Administrator and a registered Dealing Representative, balancing operational responsibilities with client-facing advisory work. 
        I’m also a CFA Level I candidate, always motivated to keep learning and progressing in my career.

        Outside of finance, I’m passionate about soccer and sports in general, the environment, staying active, and traveling. 
        My goal is to build a career where I can bring together finance, sustainability, and meaningful impact.
