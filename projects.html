          <h3>Company Fundamental Analysis (V)</h3>
          <p>I conducted a fundamental analysis of Visa Inc. using both top-down and bottom-up approaches. 
            I began with an industry assessment and competitor comparison to evaluate Visa‚Äôs positioning within the payments sector, then applied valuation models including CAPM, the intrinsic value formula ùëâ(0), and relative measures such as EPS and the P/E ratio derived from financial statements. 
            Finally, I compared my calculated intrinsic value to Visa‚Äôs actual market price, providing insight into whether the stock appeared overvalued or undervalued, while highlighting the practical connection between theoretical models and real-world market behavior.</p>

          <h3>Portfolio Analysis Assignment</h3>
          <p>As part of a portfolio management group project, I analyzed Ford (F) and Tesla (TSLA) alongside other securities to apply key concepts in corporate finance and investment theory.
            The project involved collecting and processing financial data, calculating risk and return metrics, applying models such as CAPM and portfolio optimization, and evaluating asset performance relative to the market and risk-free securities. 
            This assignment provided practical experience in applying theoretical frameworks to real financial data, strengthening both analytical and quantitative skills relevant to investment analysis and portfolio construction.</p>
