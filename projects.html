          <h3>Company Fundamental Analysis (V)</h3>
          <p>I conducted a fundamental analysis of Visa Inc. using both top-down and bottom-up approaches. 
            I began with an industry assessment and competitor comparison to evaluate Visa‚Äôs positioning within the payments sector, then applied valuation models including CAPM, the intrinsic value formula ùëâ(0), and relative measures such as EPS and the P/E ratio derived from financial statements. 
            Finally, I compared my calculated intrinsic value to Visa‚Äôs actual market price, providing insight into whether the stock appeared overvalued or undervalued, while highlighting the practical connection between theoretical models and real-world market behavior.</p>
